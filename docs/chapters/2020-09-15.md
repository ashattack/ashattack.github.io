Started making a cuttlebelle website, we cloned an already built site and deleted some files. It was confusing how you edit the yaml file on vscode and it becomes an html file on the website. 

I started Pass the Technical Interview with Javascript on Codecademy 

Instead of using the cuttlebelle website this one was built instead.
